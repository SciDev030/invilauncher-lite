The Source-Code is not exact the same of the final product. If you want support all three resolution of bada, we recommend to create for each resolution a own 'project.xml'.
We recommend to use follow settings:
- For WVGA like the integrated project.xml
- For HVGA use in your project.xml width:315 and height:145, the used hvga file can you find on "css" folder
- For WQVGA use the half of width and height from WVGA
